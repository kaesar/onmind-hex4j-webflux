/**
 * Output port for role persistence operations.
 * 
 * This interface defines the contract for role data persistence in a reactive manner.
 * It follows the hexagonal architecture pattern by defining the output boundary
 * for role repository operations. Implementations should handle the specific
 * persistence technology details (R2DBC, MongoDB, etc.) while maintaining
 * the reactive contract defined here.
 * 
 * <p>All operations are reactive and return Mono/Flux types to support non-blocking
 * database operations and backpressure handling in the reactive streams specification.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This port abstracts the persistence layer from the business logic, allowing
 * different persistence implementations without affecting the domain or application layers.</p>
