/**
 * Input port for retrieving roles from the system.

 * data retrieval, mapping to appropriate DTOs, and error handling for not found scenarios.
 * 
 * <p>All operations are reactive and return Mono/Flux types to support non-blocking
 * operations and backpressure handling in the reactive streams specification.</p>
